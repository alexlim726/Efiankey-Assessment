Question 5:

1.What is Git /SVN (Version Ctrl System)?
Your Answer: Both of them are handy tools when many developers are collaborating on one project. It helps us to manage the version of source code during the software development. It also allows each developer to have a local copy of the entire repository and the developer can work from home and merge the changes easily. Example: Developer A makes a change on code lines 78 to 80 and uploads the changed code to the repo. Developer B can just update or download from Git/SVN to receive the latest version of code for the project.

2.Explain the purpose of Backend ?
Your Answer: For me first comes to mind is managing data processing and business logic. The backend works to handle frontend requests and communicate with the database. It also protects the security of an application, a part that cannot be accessed by the user.

3.What is Web Server
Your Answer: A web server is a software program or hardware device that provides material over the internet in response to client requests. It is also a computer system that can provide online information to end users via the internet using a web browser.

4.How would you integrate tests into your workflow?
Your Answer: First I will define the scope of integration testing. Next will decide on types of tests based on the project. After the test scenarios have been outlined, collect the data that will be used to run these tests. I will continue with creating the test case and setting up the test environment. Carry out the test cases that I created. Monitor and analyze test results so that the quality of the application's performance is guaranteed. Will report if any issues and will track the issue during the test. After all tests have been successfully finished, can then release the application.

5.How would you unit test a new feature?
Your Answer: So I think first I will try to understand the functionality of the new feature. Next will be created unit tests to verify the functionality of the feature. I will use mocking to isolate the unit under test from external dependencies. Run the unit tests to ensure the new feature behaves as intended and doesn't meet any errors. Refactor code and tests as necessary based on test results, ensuring code quality.
